Problem Statement: 
The widespread use of digital technology makes privacy breaches more likely because so much private personal data is being collected and stored. Data privacy problems are now at the top of the world's agenda, and people and businesses are always fighting to keep private information safe from prying eyes. The constantly changing nature of risks and the progress made in huge data processing systems have made old ways of protecting personal data useless. Companies are required to protect customer data and follow strict data protection laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California's Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). 
Methodology: 
This project will use a mixed-method approach that combines real-world application with academic study. As a first step, we will carefully look at the theory bases of differential privacy and cryptography. First, it's important to look at the academic parts. Next, it's important to use these techniques in real-world situations, like in business and banking. So, we are going to use case studies, exercises, and models to test how well different methods work and show that they can protect privacy while allowing for a lot of data analysis. 
This study will look at differential privacy and security methods from both an academic and a practical point of view in order to find solutions to the problems that come up when systems have to deal with more and more data that is complicated and large. 
Intended Users or Group of Users and Their Requirements 
Intended Users:
The main people who will use this study are data scientists, experts, healthcare and finance companies, and other groups that deal with private or sensitive data. A lot of the time, it's up to these users to set up, enforce, and keep up with their systems' privacy and data security policies. This group is made up of lawmakers who set privacy rules, compliance officers who make sure that data security rules are followed, and software writers who make safe sites for sharing data.

Needs of Intended Users:
Target audiences, especially those who work with complicated systems and big datasets, need secure, flexible, and quick ways to keep private data safe. Sensitive information must be kept safe from unauthorized access, attacks, or mistreatment. This is especially important in fields like healthcare and finance, where sharing personal medical records and transaction data is necessary. Increasing amounts of data, new technologies like machine learning, and the appearance of new data-driven services are all making data privacy rules more difficult to understand. These groups are also required by law to follow data protection rules set by the government, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and HIPAA.

It is hard for both data scientists and businesses to find a good balance between data privacy and data use. Many businesses need to handle and analyze huge amounts of data in order to get information that helps them make decisions. But during this process, user privacy must not be broken. As the number of data breaches and cases of wrongdoing keeps going up, privacy-protecting solutions have never been more important.
Benefit of Findings:
Businesses can quickly put privacy-protecting plans into action after this study's results are released. These problems can be fixed by using differential privacy and cryptographic systems. The results will explain both the academic and practical sides of data protection laws, with a focus on how to add differential privacy and security techniques to current data systems. This will be useful for scholars and data scientists.
Put in place privacy-enhancing policies, and businesses like banks and doctors will be better able to keep their clients' personal information safe and data breaches will be less likely to happen. Also, methods that protect privacy may make following the law and regulations easier, which lowers the risk of expensive fines and damage to one's image.

Systems Requirements, Project Deliverables, and Final Project Outcome
Characteristics of Final Product:
This project will use both theory models and real-world applications to set up a complete strategy for protecting personal data in modern systems. Creating and using differential privacy methods and secure protocols will be very important for making sure that the data is safe and useful. 
Researchers in academia will look into the ideas behind the framework and then use what they find to create methods for differential privacy and cryptography. There will also be an in-depth analysis of these methods in the end product, with a focus on how well they work in real-life situations like healthcare and banking.
Stages and Deliverables:
1.	The newest study on data privacy, with a focus on differential privacy and security methods, will be looked at in this literature review. We will look into the current methods, how they can be used, and the possible study areas that aren't covered in this summary.
2.	This project will protect privacy by creating and testing methods that use cryptographic and differential privacy on the right datasets. During this step, an algorithm will be created and run. This algorithm will then be added to a test system.
3.	The created methods' ability to protect privacy will be tested and reviewed using real-world or fake data. In this part, we'll look at how the privacy measures work, and how well they work.
Technical Software’s and Practical Implementations 
•	Implementation in Python: For computing and cryptography that protects privacy, use PySyft, TenSEAL, and PyCryptodome.
•	Differential Privacy Testing: You can use Google's Differential Privacy Library to test privacy methods on sets of data.
•	Homomorphic Encryption: Use IBM's Homomorphic Encryption Library to set up encryption methods for safe data handling.
•	Simulations and Testing: Use Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab to run tests on privacy tools in controlled settings.
•	Dataset Analysis: To test privacy-preserving methods, use healthcare and banking records that are open to the public.
•	Performance Evaluation: Use Python-based statistics tools to measure accuracy loss, computing speed, and data leaks.
Outcome
In the end, there will be a privacy model that uses both cryptography and differential privacy. This will create a way to keep secret information safe in real life. Companies in many fields, like healthcare and finance, could use this way to stay in line with data protection rules and make their data privacy policies better without lowering the security or usefulness of their systems. 
Primary Research Plan
Primary Research Method:
•	Experiments: Implement differential privacy and cryptographic techniques using synthetic or publicly available datasets to test their effectiveness.
•	Simulations: Create simulated environments to observe and analyze how privacy-preserving methods behave under varying conditions (e.g., different data sizes, privacy levels).
Data Collection:
•	Datasets will be sourced from publicly available databases in the healthcare and financial sectors. These datasets will be used to test the proposed privacy methods. A moderate amount of data will be used to ensure the statistical significance of the results.

Ethical Considerations
•	Data privacy and security: The project will make sure that we follow all the rules and laws when we work with private data, such as GDPR and HIPAA. We will avoid social problems that come with sharing personal information by using records that are made public or that are available to everyone.
•	The study will look for possible flaws in privacy-preserving programs to make sure that everyone is treated equally. A big goal will be to make sure that privacy measures don't hurt weaker people more than others.
Timeline:
 
Assumptions:
•	The amount of data collected will be enough for meaningful analysis, but due to time constraints, the scale of the experiments will be limited.
•	The privacy techniques chosen are suitable for testing with the available datasets and can be adapted to other real-world applications if necessary.


Initial/Mini Literature Review
Differential Privacy:
Differential privacy is now a must for keeping personal data safe in large datasets. This mathematics model, which was first used by Dwork (2006), says that the presence or lack of a single piece of data has no effect on the overall result of data analysis. Anonymizing data is important for following the rules and keeping private data safe in finance and healthcare, two areas that are hotly discussed in the privacy literature. Differential privacy for large, difficult data sets will be changed in future work. 
Cryptographic Techniques for Data Privacy:
Cryptography is another important way to keep data safe while it is being sent or kept. Homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computing (SMPC) are two new types of cryptography that could completely change how we store and share personal information. Homomorphic encryption protects privacy during processing by letting calculations be done on encrypted data without having to decrypt it first. 
Comparative Analysis:
This study will look at differential privacy and cryptographic methods side by side to show how they work together and how they vary. Differential privacy may protect privacy well when analyzing large amounts of data, and cryptography may keep private data safe while it is being processed and sent. This study will show where the two technologies can work together to make privacy solutions that are flexible and easy for users by merging in certain ways that have to do with how to easily combine different methods.
